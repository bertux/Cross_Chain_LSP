# Working plan — decisions and next steps

Internal notes for the maintainer. They live in `tools/`, which is **not published on the website**: the server's sparse checkout excludes `tools/`, and the root `.htaccess` blocks it on Apache. Keep secrets, email credentials and private addresses out of this file anyway: the repository is public.

## 1. Where we are

### Tools online
| Page | State |
|---|---|
| Deploy, Verify, Test, Send, Publish implementation | Stable. Audited (AUDIT.md rev. 1–3). |
| `up-wallet.html` — UP Wallet | Experimental. Tested live on Base and Polygon (OpenSea sign-in, EURe swap, LI.FI, Basenames). Audited (AUDIT.md §7). |
| `up-walletconnect-basenames.html` | Deprecated 2026-10-03 (closed experiment): banner, all actions disabled, kept for reference; superseded by the UP Wallet (AUDIT R-07 decided). |
| `up-nft-receiver.html` + `contracts/NFTReceiverExtension.sol` | Experimental, merged (PR #33, #36). Tested on a local chain with LUKSO UP/LSP6 0.12.1 and 0.14.0 and on Base mainnet. The page only enables the extension; publishing it on a new chain is done in `up-publish-implementation.html` (shortcut chip), with any wallet. |
| Deploy tool section 5 + `backup-check.js` — backup controller | Add a backup controller or remove a lost one, per network; alert on Send, Test and UP Wallet when the backup is missing. Tested on a local chain with LUKSO UP/LSP6 0.12.1 and 0.14.0. Live 2026-10-02: the three maintainer UPs (ChainIntegrate, personal, Birra20venti) have a backup controller on Base and Polygon (logs in `tools/logs/2026-10-02-*-backup.txt`). |

### Decisions already taken (do not reopen without a reason)
- **Language:** code, comments, commits and docs in English; chat in Italian.
- **Chains:** the repo is not a registry of chains. No new chains added here; users use Custom RPC plus the publish page. Official chain support belongs to LUKSO.
- **Published-contracts list** in the README is frozen.
- **Funds:** never tell users to send funds to the UP before the deploy and test have succeeded.
- **`tools/`** is never served.
- **Contributors** fix their own branches (CONTRIBUTING rule 5); the maintainer reviews and merges.
- **WalletConnect Project ID** only in the server's `config.js` (git-ignored), protected by the Reown domain allowlist.
- **Alchemy API key** (free plan) only in the server's `config.js`, restricted to the site's domain in the Alchemy dashboard. Used by the Send page to list a UP's tokens and NFTs. Networks enabled in the Alchemy app: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Gnosis; others can be enabled in the dashboard without code changes.
- **Finding a UP's holdings:** Alchemy first; Blockscout as the alternative without a key (its index proved incomplete on Polygon and Base); pasting the contract address always works. The `eth_getLogs` scan was tried and removed: public RPCs allow only small block ranges, hundreds of requests per search. The list is only a shortcut: the check reads everything again from the chain.
- **Spam label:** only Alchemy's `isSpam` verdict (or Blockscout's reputation) marks a row; `spamClassifications` are signals, not a verdict. Alchemy flags Basenames as spam (false positive): accepted as is, explained in the guide. No allowlist of "trusted" contracts.
- **No browser extension impersonating a wallet.**
- **Security model of the bridge pages:** security comes from the architecture (Key Manager permissions, signing in the user's wallet) and from services (Reown Verify). Every step is shown; ChainIntegrate takes no responsibility for requests approved on unclear content.
- **UP Wallet:** one network at a time; compatibility check between UP and controller as soon as network, UP and MetaMask are set, again on every change and before every request.
- **NFT reception:** own stateless extension at the same address on every chain (`0x7F68e74483867058C806218aa05aB5527984C03e`); enabled with one atomic `executeBatch` that restores the controller's exact permission bytes.
- **RPC for Base in the pages:** `https://base-rpc.publicnode.com` (2026-10-02). `mainnet.base.org` answered 429 "too many requests" to the pages' reads (balance, backup and relayer checks, compatibility checks); publicnode gave none in the same test. The relayer service on the server keeps its own RPC in its config.
- **Gas:** **no automatic top-ups.** When a balance falls below a threshold, send an email ("network running low"); the maintainer tops up by hand.
- **Backup controller (key loss, not theft):** the genesis key (the one extracted from the UP extension) is the only controller a UP is born with on every new network. Losing it without a second admin controller locks the user out of the UP on that network. Detection rule: at least two listed controllers with identical permissions that include ADDCONTROLLER and EDITPERMISSIONS (ERC4337 bit ignored; EntryPoint and URD never count). The backup gets exactly the signer's permissions (and AllowedCalls / AllowedERC725YDataKeys). Added or removed per network from section 5 of the Deploy tool; on LUKSO, LUKSO's own tools. The alert is shown on Send, Test and UP Wallet only, for the network in use; not on `up-gas-relay.html` (operator page). Both setups are the user's choice: genesis key used daily with the backup aside, or genesis key offline with a daily second controller. Never custodial: the backup is always the user's own key; the operator's cassa is never a controller of other people's UPs.
- **No gas relay for controller or data changes:** adding or removing a controller (and any `setData`) cannot go through the 4337 path, because the EntryPoint has exactly `0x500` (no SETDATA, no ADDCONTROLLER: AUDIT G-M2). That is what keeps the relayer path from ever rewriting a UP. The controller pays gas for these. The place for "pay with the paymaster" is the Send page and the UP Wallet (calls and transfers), offered only when the UP is on the paymaster's list and set up for 4337 on that network.

## 2. Next steps

### 2.1 NFT reception (PR #33, #36)
**Base: done on 2026-09-29.**
- The extension was published and enabled on the maintainer's personal UP (`0x328A…317b`); one of the transactions is `0xf77455eb…7553`.
- The page's final check reported the NFT keys set and the controller's permissions unchanged.
- The publisher address does not matter: the extension has no owner, and its address depends only on factory, salt and bytecode.
- **Verified on mainnet:** the UP bought an ERC-1155 on OpenSea on Base. The transaction was Seaport 1.6 `fulfillAdvancedOrder`, recipient the UP, 0.00088209 ETH paid from the UP. The token is BasePaint `0xBa5e05cb…dcAc83`, id 665, and it was received by the UP through the extension. The simulation had already succeeded, which it could not do before the extension. Basescan labels the UP with its Basenames primary name.
- **Polygon: done on 2026-09-29.** The extension was published and enabled on the maintainer's personal UP (enabling tx `0x3b042f87…0000`).
- **Avalanche C-Chain: done on 2026-10-03** on the ChainIntegrate UP (`0x4a26…8c27`): extension published (tx `0xb2706aeb…9b71`) and enabled by the genesis controller (tx `0x92d50631…ae6d`); final check OK, controller permissions unchanged.
- **LUKSO: published only, NOT enabled, on 2026-09-29** (tx `0xd00aa669…aa99`). The original UP on LUKSO does not need it, because LSP8 NFTs arrive without it. It is published there so the address is the same across the whole ecosystem.
- **Source verified** on Basescan, Polygonscan and the LUKSO explorer (Blockscout) for `0x7F68e74483867058C806218aa05aB5527984C03e`, using `contracts/NFTReceiverExtension.input.json` (Standard-JSON input, solc v0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9, MIT). Do not upload `NFTReceiverExtension.json`: it is the summary file, and explorers reject it with `Unknown key "abi"`.
- **Next:**
  - **feature request opened on 2026-09-29:** https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/issues/1152 (official cross-chain ERC-721/ERC-1155 receiver extension; points to `contracts/`, the three verified explorers, the publishing page and the NFT page). Follow the replies; if LUKSO publishes an official extension, switch the NFT page and the UP Wallet to its address and say so in the README;
  - optional: teach the UP Wallet to decode Seaport orders (what is received, by whom, what is paid, to whom).

1. `git pull` on the server.
2. On Base, with the maintainer's personal UP (`0x328A…317b`) and its controller:
   1. publish the extension (once per network);
   2. "Prepare and simulate", read the plan, then "Sign and send";
   3. check that the UP Wallet shows "Receiving ERC-721/1155 NFTs: yes".
3. Buy a cheap NFT on OpenSea with the UP to confirm.
4. Repeat on Polygon if needed.

### 2.2 EURe test: Polygon → Base, delivered to the maintainer's historical wallet
**Done on 2026-09-29.** Jumper (LI.FI) through the UP Wallet on Polygon, delivered to the historical wallet on Base, then the approval revoked. The flow was:
1. `approve(Permit2, unlimited)` on EURe (tx `0x65f4…7e30`);
2. a Permit2 `PermitTransferFrom` signature for the exact amount, spender LI.FI Permit2 Proxy `0x89c6…f818`, accepted by the UP through ERC-1271;
3. the bridge transaction (tx `0xc9d6…6a83`);
4. the revoke on revoke.cash, `approve(Permit2, 0)` (tx `0xf105…27b5`).

Lessons:
- Jumper always asks for an unlimited Permit2 approval; revoke it after use.
- A bridge transaction can need about 1.8 M gas, so keep about 1–2 POL on the controller.
- After a failed attempt, do not use Jumper's "Try again": disconnect, reconnect and start from "Review bridge".

The notes below are kept for reference.
- **Route 1 (chosen first): Jumper (LI.FI) through the UP Wallet on Polygon**, destination "send to a different wallet" = the historical wallet on Base.
  1. With "Simulation only": check the approval (EURe, spender LI.FI Diamond, **exact** amount, not unlimited).
  2. Send the approval for real, since the bridge simulation needs it.
  3. Simulate the bridge transaction and compare the amount received on Base with the fees.
  4. Send only if the fees are acceptable. Check that the Base EURe address is the official Monerium one.
- **Route 2 (fallback):** send EURe from the UP to the historical wallet **on Polygon** (plain transfer), then bridge with the Monerium app from the historical wallet. Only the historical wallet must be linked to the Monerium profile, on both networks; the UP does not.
- **Done (2026-09-29/30):** the Send page (`up-send-funds.html`) now transfers ERC-20 tokens and NFTs (ERC-721, ERC-1155, LSP7/LSP8) as well as native currency, so a plain token or NFT transfer does not need an external dApp. It lists what the UP holds through Alchemy (verified live on Polygon and Base) or Blockscout. PRs #37–#42.

### 2.3 Gas monitoring by email (to build)
- **What:** a small read-only script on the VPS, run hourly by cron. It needs no private key.
- **Config (one line per network):** network name, RPC, address to watch, threshold. Adding a network = adding a line.
- **Behaviour:**
  - one email when an address falls below its threshold; at most one reminder per 24 h while it stays low;
  - one email when it is back above the threshold;
  - a separate email when an RPC does not answer, so a dead RPC is not mistaken for an empty balance.
- **Where:** `tools/gas-monitor/` in the repo. Because the server's web checkout excludes `tools/`, install it from a separate clone outside the web root (for example `/home/ubuntu/cross-chain-ops`). The config file and the email credentials exist only on the server, never in the repo.
- **To decide before writing it:**
  1. addresses and thresholds (to start: the controllers on Base and Polygon; later the relayer; maybe the UPs' USDC balance);
  2. how the VPS sends email (existing `sendmail`/`msmtp`, or an SMTP account with credentials in a server-only file);
  3. the recipient address.

### 2.4 Gas abstraction: relayer with our own ERC-4337 paymaster (in progress)
**Decision (2026-09-30).** ERC-4337 with our own paymaster, not LSP25 and not a third-party gas tank.
- **Why not LSP25:** relay calls need an EIP-191 version 0 signature, which MetaMask cannot produce without `eth_sign`.
- **Why 4337:** `Extension4337` accepts `personal_sign`.
- **Pieces:**
  - `contracts/UPPaymaster.sol` pays only for allowlisted UPs, with a cost cap. It is owned by the maintainer's "cassa" address and has the same address on every chain.
  - The relayer (bundler) is an EOA generated from a terminal on the VPS, with no permission on any UP. The EntryPoint reimburses it from the paymaster deposit, so its balance does not drain.
  - Top-ups: from the cassa (USDC), one transaction through a gas-refuel service (e.g. gas.zip) to the paymaster address on each chain. Email alerts when a deposit is low. No automatic top-ups.
- **Status: working on Base mainnet (2026-09-30).**
  - **Addresses** (the same on every chain):
    - cassa (paymaster owner): `0x6C5d0fa04aE90371e809114E9C3932ea7a3715C9`;
    - paymaster: `0xb353565d1f801E7402DBC267b8C0E30E3540D4eD`, source verified on Basescan;
    - `Extension4337`: `0x6D375232863E179Ba1B3348C9087E30d5D5ed4B2`.
  - **Base transactions,** all done with `up-gas-relay.html`. The full page log is in `tools/logs/2026-09-30-base-gas-relay.txt`:
    - paymaster published `0x2ea09cea4188716895642f077a56a8f6c37b41ecc7165cb11cafcbf9e6e45e11`;
    - top-up of 0.0005 ETH `0xfab74f975c589d8494cf3a542e3abc45405461aacab74290b073004f44ac889c`;
    - cap 0.0003 ETH `0x2faf23053f4f8d9dfa00cafe7b012ed14023c6b1853da705f14c58ecba205ef5`;
    - ChainIntegrate UP allowlisted `0x5e8e400488a4b2501bf0f83d42436eb9f14c26095a80a31a3c681a0989b7357e`;
    - `Extension4337` published `0x55b5556f03fe01cd0084785751c16c18459f077adb4f031fc2465cc2b6ae0856`;
    - ChainIntegrate UP set up by its controller `0x9C8F…5C9c` `0x22f697efa2a63179170453933b1fbc457f309d29da7eb7e64c624139a72fb3d9`. Its permissions went from `0x7f3f06` to `0xff3f06`, and the EntryPoint became a controller with `0x500`.
  - **First sponsored operation:** `0x4ca591a7ecfcb4a9aca8af9d78cf3b2901bacabc5cd6df6f9d9575e803403721`. The UP sent 0.0001 ETH to the cassa, signed by the controller with `personal_sign`, relayed by the cassa.
    - The controller's balance was unchanged.
    - The paymaster paid 0.0000012 ETH.
  - **Stray paymaster:** `0x4D66c2d931ac6777CB6E64e20F6eBdFdc1030705` was published by mistake (tx `0x9811c6cc00caa157213333432ed28741fd9a700012110b5746d64a45ebd04770`) with the personal controller `0x86F7…c6f2` as owner, because the page had filled in the owner from the account connected first. It is empty. Ignore it and never fund it.
- **Lessons from the Base test,** fixed in `up-gas-relay.html` afterwards:
  - **The relayer paid about 2.1× its reimbursement.** Two causes:
    - a fixed `preVerificationGas` of 60,000, now computed with the reference bundler formula plus the L1 data fee from the OP-stack `GasPriceOracle`, plus 15%;
    - MetaMask choosing a higher tip than the operation's, now the relay transaction uses the operation's own fee fields.
  - **The owner field** kept the first connected account. The page now warns when the owner entered is not the active account.
  - **A click during a pending transaction** was dropped. Action buttons are now locked while an action runs, and the check retries instead of dropping the request.
- **Confirmed after the fixes (2026-09-30):** two more sponsored operations on Base.
  - `0x66d1f67e755559e2b6d00c1111ff5f4a7c0d033c0b3715edae0c5849bb95a931`, relayed by the controller.
  - `0xf74b8e927b35f76fea85520d419ed596b184823959ddcaabcb39cbfda4b1c0f7`, relayed by the cassa. The controller's balance was unchanged.
  - In both, the relayer ended about +0.00000014 ETH, the 15% margin.
  - The paymaster paid about 0.0000011 ETH per operation, less than half a cent. The 0.0005 ETH deposit covers about 450 operations.
- **Revoke (2026-10-01):** `up-gas-relay.html` can turn 4337 off on a UP with one controller transaction. It removes the extension key, the EntryPoint's permissions and its entry in `AddressPermissions[]`, and the 4337 bit. It restores the UP exactly as before the setup.
- **`Extension4337` status (answered in the LUKSO dev chat, 2026-10-03):** experimental, never audited. Treat it as the least proven part of the system (contract risk). A professional audit (paymasters and the 4337 flow) is required before the paid service holds significant customer funds; see the item below. The exposure of the funds themselves comes from the hot controller key and is the same with or without 4337: see `AUDIT.md` 8.5.
- **Independent AI-assisted review (2026-10-01):** `AUDIT.md` section 8, full report in `tools/audits/2026-10-01-extension4337-ups.md`. P1–P5 hold on the three Base UPs; the 4337 setup adds no way to move funds beyond what the controller key already allows.
  - Key model (maintainer's analysis, `AUDIT.md` 8.5): the original controller cannot be retired, because every redeploy recreates it; keep it offline for new deployments only, and use a second controller (ideally a hardware wallet) for daily use on each chain. To do later, as an option in the pages.
  - G-L3 fixed: the relayer also refuses an inflated `preVerificationGas`.
  - G-M2: the configuration check is in `up-gas-relay.html` section 2 (read-only, no wallet; it runs by itself and says what to do and where). The same checks run every hour on the server (`tools/relayer/monitor.js`, systemd timer), with email to the maintainer on change via the Aruba SMTP account; install steps in `tools/relayer/README.md`. **Installed on the server 2026-10-01:** test email received, first run "all clear" on the three Base UPs. This also covers the gas-balance alerts of section 2.3 for the gas relay (paymaster deposit, relayer balance). Originally planned as: a configuration checker for every UP and chain (EntryPoint exactly `0x500`, extension key and code hash, controller 4337 bit, allowlist, paymaster owner/cap/deposit, relayer balance), usable on demand and by the periodic email monitor.
- **No EntryPoint on LUKSO mainnet (checked 2026-10-01):** both canonical addresses have no code, v0.6 `0x5FF137D4…2789` and v0.7 `0x00000000…a032`. So `Extension4337` is not in use on LUKSO mainnet with the standard EntryPoint, a strong hint that it never went to production.
  - The EntryPoint v0.6 was deployed through Nick's factory, so it could be published on LUKSO at the same address by replaying its creation transaction from another chain. The publishing page would need to read that transaction from a chain other than LUKSO.
  - Possible later: 4337 on LUKSO too, so the UP is operated the same way on every chain (same `personal_sign` flow, same relayer). Only an idea for now.
- **Page usability:** the check runs its reads in parallel, so buttons react faster. A hint under section 4 says which account each step needs. If MetaMask does not report an account switch, pressing "Connect MetaMask" updates the page, and the signed operation is kept.
- **Next:**
  1. Allowlist and set up more UPs, then other chains (Polygon first).
     - **Maintainer's personal UP `0x328A19Ab63744AAF3d0AeBfB8e6Dc5246fAf317b`: done on Base (2026-09-30).** Page log in `tools/logs/2026-09-30-base-personal-up.txt`.
       - Cassa transactions: allowlist `0x0483703823f3141228573f5cef7ae4493de7c442008e642b71e7e7c3e747b9bc`, cap `0xcc722322ae744d8be695aa9be6c9ac3e01cbfb350ccd9361f5145addce9c7017`.
       - Setup by the controller `0x86F7…c6f2` (Key Manager `0x25d0…A222`): `0xba9605614d28f25cb8f84cc8679f1dc80e5e565124439605eee712e84fa3f0cd`. Permissions `0x7f3f06` → `0xff3f06`; final check passed.
       - First operation through the site relayer: `0xd6b6916b3ce0c05bce9cfd84f972643ee46bbf3fdefc177f54d7966457b039b7`. Controller unchanged, paymaster paid 0.0000012 ETH, relayer +0.00000015 ETH.
     - **Birra20venti's UP `0x1d62B8d2c63B942095AD3C7FFc7e845195D9E718`: allowlisted and set up on Base (2026-09-30).** Page log in `tools/logs/2026-09-30-base-birra20venti-up.txt`.
       - Allowlisted by the cassa: `0xdbe267b10f969a217cf526fe25e3a2e7fbfe2dae12c7f299b841b08e01993006`.
       - Setup by its controller `0x4346…9d4c` (Key Manager `0x595D…4feE`): `0x5b327db2833bbcdb5d3e780b526cec0eca4a2bfcb4e8d917fbbce17a12ad040d`. Permissions `0x7f3f06` → `0xff3f06`; final check passed.
       - First successful operation through the site relayer, after funding the UP: `0x2273f39b52b819e0c26cf3ed8d00c3761acf12979db42a67b2897a7617943393` (nonce 1). Controller unchanged, paymaster paid 0.0000011 ETH, relayer +0.00000014 ETH. Log appended to the same file.
       - Earlier first test operation (0.0001 ETH to the cassa) refused by the site relayer before sending: the execution simulation reverted with a UP custom error, most likely `ERC725X_InsufficientBalance` (no ETH on the UP on Base). Nothing was spent. The relayer now decodes UP and Key Manager errors, and the page checks the UP balance before signing.
     - Feedback from the second run, fixed in `up-gas-relay.html`:
       - plain-words explanation at the top ("read on, then read this again");
       - the allowlist moved to section 3, next to the UP address, with its own status box and a note that MetaMask asks the cassa to confirm a transaction;
       - the owner field is no longer taken from the first connected account: it is filled from the site relayer's paymaster owner and remembered in the browser; notes say it must always be the cassa and that all paymaster operations are done with the cassa;
       - the "B with a MetaMask account" button is removed: B always goes through the site relayer.
     - Feedback from this run, fixed in `up-gas-relay.html`: about 20 seconds with no visible sign between a click and the MetaMask popup (a fixed status box now shows each step), and a step-by-step guide in section 0 (roles, connecting several MetaMask accounts, what to redo after a reload, order of the steps).
     - **Polygon (2026-10-01), working:** paymaster published at the same address `0xb353…D4eD` (tx `0x36a6476ae9e27c925287b0e0d52b18662862c695a2242a4eb32cff66babd1f9d`), `Extension4337` published at `0x6D37…d4B2` (tx `0xd661f795a36b8ccf462738cb0ccd88d9554f3977e8a04f311a33465037242488`), ChainIntegrate UP allowlisted and set up by its controller (tx `0xa82258fce91b4917a09d9585b5cf92b8b37cb2b9c6be073b96ffe0555832280d`, final check passed).

Paymaster deposit 3 POL, cap raised to 1 POL (the computed maximum cost of an op was 0.72 POL). **First operation through the site relayer: `0x8b282033a806d063c6dcb08f62f4e9ce95138f5e16ad37681399e485b83131b1`** (nonce 0): controller unchanged, paymaster paid 0.065 POL, relayer +0.006 POL; log in `tools/logs/2026-10-01-polygon-chainintegrate-up.txt`.

Personal UP (`0x328A…317b`): set up (tx `0xd69ee3963dc5f26c855d236aaf25e2150fded057ceb642086f8ec9574158d475`) and first operation `0x2848d41c926b82eb6bf0dd707009c2cc019ccc27b8f11861d802e70f0a5cc452` (controller unchanged, paymaster 0.064 POL). Birra20venti UP: allowlisted (tx `0x668d4044dd96cc0aaa7dc8d16213109f87c226052d49fb8a71ec2d69d70c8862`), set up (tx `0xe46e040bca99210d9dae51681abba4bd08a670e30df7548f093f878388a9e43e`); the first attempt was stopped by the page before signing because the UP held 0 POL; after funding it, first operation `0x2c49143bd4730b224fddfec4cf716082880446ebda849721212d0410378969ed` (controller unchanged, paymaster 0.063 POL). All three Polygon UPs added to the monitor. The reorganised page (check in section 2, with actions) was enough to set them up without the guide.
  2. Check whether gas.zip can deliver directly to the paymaster.
  3. The relayer service on the VPS: **installed and working (2026-09-30).** It is `tools/relayer/`, installed as described in its README.
     - Relayer address: `0xbb683923c2Df0269996C0E2F276A5097cE863C2F`. Key in `/etc/crosschain-relayer/relayer.key` on the server; the maintainer keeps a copy in a password manager.
     - Funded with 0.001 ETH on Base: `0x3e060f31e6f0b85f7e2b09fef5922982ed0c6256d58bacf470edb7a8f3422ba1`.
     - nginx passes `/relay/` to `127.0.0.1:8787`, in the site's HTTPS server block. The previous config is saved as `/root/crosschain-lukso.nginx.bak`.
     - First operation through the site relayer: `0x74ec840e4a389f9a5841437bb371005c52ad13ea4fc16a698cb25eac9f3cdebb`, nonce 3 of the ChainIntegrate UP. The UP sent 0.0001 ETH to the cassa; the controller spent nothing; the paymaster paid 0.0000011 ETH; the relayer ended +0.00000015 ETH. Page log in `tools/logs/2026-09-30-base-site-relayer.txt`.
     - It runs from its own clone in `/opt`, with its key in `/etc`, as a systemd service on `127.0.0.1:8787`. The web server passes `/relay/` to it (nginx or Apache).
     - It uses the same `preVerificationGas` and fee rules as the page, and accepts only listed paymasters.
     - It simulates the execution alone as well as `handleOps`. When only the execution fails, `handleOps` does not revert, so the paymaster would pay for nothing. Found by the local test.
     - The page has a second B button, "Send through the site relayer". It stays off, with a note, while `relay/info` does not answer.
     - To install: `node -v`, the web server type, then the README steps. The relayer address is generated on the server and funded with about 0.001 ETH on Base.
  4. **Done (2026-10-02, in test):** Send page and UP Wallet option "Pay the gas with the site relayer" (`gas-relay-client.js`). Shown only when the site relayer serves the network, the UP is on a site paymaster's list (cap and deposit above 0), the UP has Extension4337 and the EntryPoint exactly `0x500`, and the connected controller has the 4337 permission; otherwise a note says what is missing. Off by default. The operation is simulated on the EntryPoint path, the execution gas limit is estimated (at most 1M, the relayer's limit), the maximum cost is checked against cap and deposit, and it is built again with current fees right before signing. The outcome is read from `UserOperationEvent`, never from the receipt status alone; the UP Wallet returns the hash to the dApp only once the UP's operation succeeded, an error otherwise. Local test: 19/19 on LUKSO 0.12.1 and 0.14.0. To do: live test on Base and Polygon, logs.
  5. ~~Verify `Extension4337`'s source~~ **Done (2026-10-01):** verified on Basescan and Polygonscan with `contracts/Extension4337.input.json` (rebuilt: identical code; LUKSO's metadata file is not on IPFS), both "Exact Match". See `contracts/README.md`.

The notes below are the earlier LSP25 design, kept for reference.
- **Goal:** controllers never need gas on any network. They sign; a relayer submits through `KeyManager.executeRelayCall` (LSP25). The signature binds nonce, chainId and validity window.
- **Relayer:**
  - one EOA with the same address on every network;
  - no permission on any UP, so a compromised key can only fail to submit;
  - a small gas balance per network, watched by the email monitor (2.3) and topped up by hand.
- **Who may use it:** only operations signed by controllers of UPs on an allowlist set by the maintainer.
- **Optional reimbursement:** the signed operation may include a small USDC payment from the UP, so gas costs stay traceable per UP.
- **Scaling:** adding a network = one config line (chainId, RPC, threshold, UPs served).
- **First concrete step:** a small test page, no server. The controller signs an LSP25 relay call for a harmless operation on Base, and a second account submits it. Goal: confirm that relay calls work on redeployed UPs (controller `0x7f3f06` includes EXECUTE_RELAY_CALL).
- **Research results (2026-09-29)**, from web searches only: LI.FI and Relay APIs and the LUKSO docs are blocked from the dev environment.
  - The official LUKSO bridge (Hyperlane, live since August 2025) supports **LYX between LUKSO and Ethereum**; stablecoins and other networks are announced for later phases. No USDC on LUKSO with real liquidity was found.
  - LUKSO was not found among the chains supported by LI.FI or Relay; RocketX lists an Ethereum ↔ LUKSO route.
  - Therefore a **treasury on LUKSO is not practical today**. If a treasury is ever needed, the hub would be native USDC on a CCTP chain (Base, Polygon, Avalanche, …). This is moot while top-ups are manual.
- **To verify later:**
  - which networks in our list have native USDC with CCTP;
  - whether Hyperlane has opened stablecoin routes to LUKSO;
  - ERC-4337 via LUKSO's `Extension4337` with a USDC paymaster, as an alternative to our own relayer.

### 2.5 UP identity viewer across chains
**Phase 1 done (2026-10-02): `up-identity.html`.** Local test 16/16 on LUKSO 0.12.1 and 0.14.0 (same profile, older profile, legacy JSONURL, hash mismatch, gateway fallback, data: URI, HTML in the name shown as text, no profile, no UP, controllers and backup). To do: check on the live site that `ipfs.chainintegrate.it` answers the browser (CORS); otherwise the public gateways take over.

A page that reads and shows a UP's LSP3 identity on any network where it is deployed (Base, Polygon, …), not only on LUKSO. The page itself is the interpreter: no claim that the chain or third parties recognise the standard.
- **Phase 1, read only (first):**
  - input: UP address and network (`chains.js`, same pattern as the other pages);
  - `getData` of `LSP3Profile` = `keccak256("LSP3Profile")` = `0x5ef83ad9559033e6e941db7d7c495acdce616347d28e90c7ce47cbfcfcad3bc5`; decode the VerifiableURI (LSP2), fetch the JSON, **check its hash against the declared one** before showing anything; show name, description, images, links, tags;
  - IPFS through ChainIntegrate's own node `ipfs.chainintegrate.it` (public gateway for reading; uploads only from allowlisted IPs), a public gateway only as fallback. To check: the gateway sends CORS headers for the site's origin;
  - **compare with LUKSO:** a redeploy copies only the data in the original creation, so on other networks `LSP3Profile` is the creation-time value, or empty. Show the value on the chosen network next to the current one on LUKSO and say when they differ;
  - controllers and permissions from `backup-check.js` (already written), including the backup status.
  - No VerifiableURI / IPFS code exists in the repo yet (not in `up-wallet.html` either): written new, shared if reused.
- **Phase 2, publish (only once phase 1 is solid):** write `LSP3Profile` on that network (for example, align it with LUKSO's), only if the connected controller has SETDATA there (checked, not assumed). **Done 2026-10-03** (section 6 of `up-identity.html`): copies LUKSO's verified value only; one transaction, paid by the controller (no gas relay for data changes). Decision: no pinning of the LSP3 or LSP4 files from the page for now; LUKSO's IPFS gateway serves them, pinning can be added later if needed.
- **Token and collection images, light/dark theme: done 2026-10-03** (`asset-list.js`, `theme.js`).
  - **Not through the gas relay as it is:** writing data through 4337 needs SETDATA on the EntryPoint, which breaks the G-M2 invariant (EntryPoint exactly `0x500`). The controller signs and pays gas, as on the other pages. A gasless alternative (e.g. LSP25 `executeRelayCall` sent by a relayer) would be a new mechanism, to be designed and audited separately.
  - Security-sensitive: AUDIT.md entry and a log in `tools/logs/` after a real test.
- **Rules:** EN/IT texts in plain language; an explicit note that this is ChainIntegrate's reading of ERC725Y data, not native recognition by the chain or third parties; never suggest sending funds before reading and writing have been verified.

## 3. Other open items
- **Site index = the guide: done 2026-10-03** on the server: nginx `index up-crosschain-guide.html;` in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/crosschain-lukso` (previous file kept as `crosschain-lukso.bak` next to it).
- **Site relayer on Avalanche: done 2026-10-03.** Chain 43114 added to `/etc/crosschain-relayer/config.json` (RPC `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`, paymaster `0xb353…D4eD`, `minBalanceWarn` 0.01) and to the monitor (ChainIntegrate UP, `minPaymasterDeposit` 0.01); relayer funded with 0.05 AVAX. First relayed send: `tools/logs/2026-10-03-avalanche-send-relayer.txt`. The relayer clone in `/opt/crosschain-relayer` checks out the whole repo (sparse checkout not active); harmless, it is outside the web root.
- **Sponsor (verifying) paymaster: live on Avalanche, Polygon and Base 2026-10-04.**
  - Contract `contracts/UPVerifyingPaymaster.sol` (GPL-3.0; same `getHash` as base-org/paymaster, which Cantina reviewed; AI-assisted review 2026-10-04, AUDIT.md section 10) at `0xbEA7…d21e` on the three chains, owner the cassa, same signer.
  - Site support merged in PR #93.
  - Signing service in the private repository `cross-chain-sponsor`, running on the server (`/opt/crosschain-sponsor`, port 8788, nginx `/relay/sponsor/`), with a weekly report by email (Mondays 08:00, CSV attached).
  - The ChainIntegrate UP is off the `UPPaymaster` allowlist on all three chains, on purpose: it uses the sponsor paymaster.
  - The monitor checks the sponsor paymaster and the service, and alarms on a fast deposit drawdown.
  - First sponsored operation: `tools/logs/2026-10-04-avalanche-sponsor-paymaster.txt`.
  - **Paid subscriptions (2026-10-04):** 5 USDC (Circle-native) paid from the UP to ChainIntegrate's UP, with the gas paid by the site; one balance per UP for every chain; price per operation 0.01 USDC on Base, 0.02 on Polygon and Avalanche, charged when the operation runs; manual activation with an e-mail. Page `up-subscribe.html`; the rules, the ledger and the e-mails are in the private service.
  - To do: one test operation on Polygon and one on Base; a professional audit of `UPVerifyingPaymaster`, `UPPaymaster` and the 4337 flow before the service holds significant customer funds (until then, the pages and README say there is none); ask an accountant about the tax treatment of the USDC received.
- **The site relayer is for the maintainer's personal use.** A "pro" version (public service) is under evaluation; it needs a new paymaster contract (verifying paymaster: the service signs each operation it agrees to pay), not the current `UPPaymaster`.
- **Licenses: done 2026-10-03** (`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`): paymaster GPL-3.0; WalletConnect bundle under Reown's WalletConnect Community License (notice in the pages' footer, copy in `vendor/`). **For a paid / public version:** that license requires a paid commercial license above 500 monthly active users or 2.5M monthly RPC calls, and requires Reown's relay network; evaluate it (or an alternative) before launching. **To evaluate:** AGPL-3.0 for `tools/relayer/` (the part that would become the service).
- **Contract source verification (done 2026-10-04):** all four contracts verified on the main explorers (Basescan, Polygonscan, Snowscan). Blockscout and Snowtrace are tracked as best effort only. Table in `contracts/README.md`, "Source verification status".
- **Gas pages split (2026-10-04):** `up-gas-relay.html` is now the user's page (check, UP setup, revoke; the check ends with whether the site pays the UP's gas). `up-gas-relay-admin.html` is the operator's page (paymasters, sponsor paymaster, allowlist, test operation), not linked from the public pages. Both run `gas-relay-page.js`. The guide points users to the user page and to `up-subscribe.html`.
- **Arbitrum One (2026-10-04):** the ChainIntegrate UP is deployed and set up; `UPPaymaster` and `UPVerifyingPaymaster` are published at their usual addresses, with signer and caps (0.0003 ETH). Arbitrum adds the L1 data cost to the relayer's transaction as extra gas, which the EntryPoint does not reimburse: the pages and the relayer now add it to `preVerificationGas` (`NodeInterface.gasEstimateL1Component`). All four contracts are source-verified on Arbiscan. Still to do: Arbitrum in the relayer's and the service's configuration, the relayer's ETH, one test operation.
- **Ledger (hardware wallet), to do:** test with a real Ledger connected to MetaMask, with small amounts on Base:
  1. add the Ledger as a controller with the 4337 permission;
  2. a normal send;
  3. a send with the gas paid by the site.

  Expected to work: transactions need "Blind signing" on in the Ledger's Ethereum app; the relayer signature is a `personal_sign` of a 32-byte hash; EIP-712 is readable on Nano S Plus/X/Stax. The sponsor approval is valid 5 minutes. Then add a short "Using a Ledger" section to the guide.
- **Gas relay page, to do:** let an admin controller give the 4337 permission to another controller (e.g. the backup), paid by the admin, so a backup with no funds can still sign relayed operations. Today the setup gives the bit only to the signer.
- **Guide: done 2026-10-03.** Identity right after Send, with the current description (tokens, controllers, capabilities, section 6 that writes); Send mentions the relayer option; step 8 points to Identity; step 9 explains the 4337 permission for the backup; the funds note says when the relayer pays the gas.
- **`chains.js` (PR #21, Bertrand, merged 2026-09-30):** the five original tool pages load the shared list. `up-wallet.html`, `up-nft-receiver.html` and `up-gas-relay.html` were switched too in the follow-up PR. Only the deprecated v2 page keeps its own list. After the pull, check on the server that the network menus populate and that explorer links open.
- **UP Wallet hint:** add a short note: "if the dApp hangs after the page delivered the answer, disconnect all sessions, disconnect on the dApp and reconnect with a new `wc:` link; do not reload the dApp with the session open".
- **AUDIT R-06:** second review of `up-wallet.html` before removing the "experimental" label.
- **AUDIT R-07:** decided 2026-10-03: Basenames demo deprecated.
- **AUDIT R-02 / I-03:** Content-Security-Policy and security headers.
- **AUDIT R-03 / L-07:** refresh stale RPCs (e.g. `rpc.sepolia.org`).
- **`banner.png`:** about 6 MB; optimise it.
